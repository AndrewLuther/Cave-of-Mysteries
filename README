This code implements an original composition I created called "Cave Of Mysteries", and can
be run in the Sonic Pi software, which uses a Ruby-based coding environment.

In the Sonic Pi envronment, first run the "Functions" code and then run the "Form" code
to hear the piece. The "Loop" code allows to hear a repeated loop of all the elements of the 
piece.

Thanks for listening!
