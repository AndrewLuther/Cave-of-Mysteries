Project: Cave of Mysteries
Creator: Andrew Luther
Creation Date: August 4th 2021

Cave of Mysteries implements an original composition I created. The code can
be run in the Sonic Pi software, which uses a Ruby-based coding environment. Sonic Pi is a 
code-based music-creation and performance tool. 

In the Sonic Pi envronment, first run the "Functions" code and then run the "Form" code
to hear the piece. The "Loop" code repeats all the elements of the piece.

The piece can also be heard on my soundcloud as an audio file: https://soundcloud.com/andrew-luther-182929613/cave-of-mysteries?si=09521c20945f40bfbaa651c29c2c1976
